# CS/EE 120B: Introduction to Embedded Systems - Custom Lab Project
Welcome to my CS 120B custom laboratory project repository for the course "Introduction to Embedded Systems" at UC Riverside. This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources for my custom laboratory project, "The Dinosaur Game on AVR".

## Project Description

This project is a recreation of the classic Dinosaur Game using an Elegoo Uno R3 and AVR programming. The game features both single and two-player modes, utilizing a joystick for controls, an ST7735 graphic LCD for visual outputs, and a passive buzzer for sound. State indicators are implemented using three LEDs (white, green, and red).
